# Phase 2.5.3 — Application Shell Report

## Status

Completed

## Objective

Implement a reusable application shell foundation in the frontend without adding product-specific screens, authentication, API connections, or business logic.

## Changes Made

- Added a reusable `AppShell` component for the main application frame.
- Added `Header`, `BottomNavigation`, and `MobileContainer` layout components.
- Integrated the shell into `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`.
- Extended global CSS for shell layout, responsive spacing, and RTL-friendly mobile-first structure.
- Kept scope limited to layout foundation and placeholders only.

## Layout Architecture

- `AppShell` composes static layout structure with a sticky top header, centered mobile container, and bottom navigation.
- `MobileContainer` enforces responsive content width and consistent padding.
- `Header` provides a reusable top bar foundation with placeholder action buttons.
- `BottomNavigation` provides a mobile-friendly navigation shell with placeholder tab items.

## Components Created

- `apps/web/src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/mobile-container.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/bottom-navigation.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/header.tsx`

## Files Created

- `apps/web/src/components/layout/app-shell.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/mobile-container.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/bottom-navigation.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/layout/header.tsx`
- `docs/phase-2.5.3-application-shell-report.md`

## Files Modified

- `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`

## Dependency Changes

- No new dependencies were added.

## Build Verification

- `pnpm build` passed successfully for `@castaminofen/shared-types`, `@castaminofen/web`, and `@castaminofen/api`.

## Lint Verification

- `pnpm lint` passed successfully across the monorepo.

## Remaining Work

- Add actual feature routes and page content in later phases.
- Implement player shell and real navigation destinations in a future phase.

## Deferred Items

- No API integration.
- No product screens beyond shell placeholders.
- No authentication or user-specific behavior.

## Scope Compliance Audit

- No business features were added.
- Shell components are foundation-only.
- No routing logic was introduced.
- BottomNavigation remains a layout placeholder only; no real routes, navigation flow, or product tabs were implemented.
- No Home page implementation, Search feature, Library feature, Profile feature, Podcast UI, or Player UI were introduced.

## Scope Clarification

این فاز محدود به ساخت app shell و لایه‌ی layout پایه بود. featureهای MVP موجود در ریپو، از جمله auth و pages مرتبط با podcast/episode، خارج از محدوده‌ی این فاز باقی می‌مانند و همچنان فعال‌اند.
