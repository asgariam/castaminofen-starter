# Phase 2.5.4 — Frontend Infrastructure Report

## Status

Completed

## Objective

Implement the frontend infrastructure foundation for future feature development without adding product pages, authentication flows, or business API integrations.

## Changes Made

- Added a shared frontend API client layer under the web app’s infrastructure path.
- Centralized public environment access for frontend configuration.
- Reworked the React Query provider setup to use a reusable query client factory.
- Introduced reusable frontend error utilities for normalization and message handling.
- Kept the existing app shell and current feature integrations intact while moving the foundation to shared modules.

## API Client Foundation

- Added a generic API client abstraction for future frontend infrastructure use, including request URL building, JSON parsing, and structured error handling.
- Kept the client environment-aware via a centralized public env helper.
- Kept the layer intentionally generic and not tied to any specific business endpoint group.

## Environment Configuration

- Added a dedicated public environment module for frontend variables.
- Centralized access to NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV.
- Prevented direct process.env usage from spreading across the frontend codebase.

## React Query Foundation

- Added a dedicated React Query configuration module.
- Updated the provider composition to use a reusable query client factory.
- Preserved development-friendly defaults such as retries, stale-time, and refetch-on-focus behavior.

## Error Handling Foundation

- Added reusable error classes and normalization helpers.
- Prepared the infrastructure for future UI error handling without introducing feature-specific screens.

## Provider Architecture

- Kept the provider composition minimal and scalable.
- Ensured the query provider remains composable for future theme, auth, and player providers.

## Files Created

- apps/web/src/shared/lib/api-client.ts
- apps/web/src/shared/lib/env.ts
- apps/web/src/shared/lib/errors.ts
- apps/web/src/shared/lib/react-query.ts

## Files Modified

- apps/web/src/lib/api.ts
- apps/web/src/providers/react-query-provider.tsx

## Dependency Changes

- No new dependencies were added.

## Build Verification

- pnpm build completed successfully.

## Lint Verification

- pnpm lint completed successfully.

## Scope Compliance Audit

- Infrastructure only.
- No business endpoints.
- No feature hooks.
- No product data fetching.
- No product features were added.
- No pages were created.
- No business APIs were connected.
- The implementation remained limited to reusable frontend infrastructure.

## Remaining Work

- Future phases can build on this foundation for auth, player, offline, and feature-specific data fetching.

## Deferred Items

- Authentication headers and token refresh logic remain out of scope.
- Feature-specific hooks and UI components remain deferred.

## Next Recommended Phase

Pending project roadmap approval.
